## Introduction
This app is created as part of a project that puts OOP concepts and Java development skills to the test. The app is a text-based UI restaurant ordering app where the user can:
* Search for a particular dish using partial or full dish name
* Browse available dishes by viewing menus categorized into `Appetizers`, `Main Course`, and `Desserts`
* Add items to the cart
* Modify item quantities in the cart along with the removal of not needed items
* Add special instructions or requests to the order
* Add a valid promo code to receive discounts
* Choose payment method
## Files in this repo
The repo contains a folder named `Deliverables` that contains the following files:
* `ROI_Report - ROI_Report.pdf` which contains a return of investment report of the project for the first year
* `FlowChart.pdf` which contains a flowchart showing the general flow of the program
* `UML_DIAGRAM.pdf` which contains a UML diagram that shows the used classes and their relations
The repo also contains the app source code in an `IntelliJ` project.
Please note that the app uses `openjdk-22`.
Finally, there is a live demo video in the `Demo` folder that shows the app running with an ordering scenario using both browsing and search features.
